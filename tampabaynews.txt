I started out covering politics in my home state of Illinois, with stints in Wisconsin, Virginia and Washington, D.C., before settling in Florida in 2015. I'll take the heat over snow any day.

state love to joke that Florida doesn't have seasons, but I disagree. No, our leaves don't change colors in the fall. We don't have to spend our winters shoveling away snow. But anybody that's lived here knows that June through November is hurricane season, and I'll be here every day to keep you informed about all tropical activity before and after it reaches our state. I also hope to be your go-to for weather stories that matter to you throughout the entire year — from cold fronts to dry spells. I grew up in Zephyrhills, went to college at USF and have lived in Tampa Bay for all 21 years of my life. If you can't tell by that alone, I love it here and plan to stay.","role":"Breaking News Reporter — Weather","slug":"josh-fiallo","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/tbt/67f63f79-0493-40f0-afc0-bfbfdee81f65.png","custom_tagline":"Contact Josh Fiallo at jfiallo@tampabay.com or (813) 778-4282.

and medicine, and how they affect providers and patients in Tampa Bay and throughout Florida. I’ve been a Sunshine State resident since I was 4 and likely will never leave, though my favorite season is whenever it’s coldest. I’m a proud graduate of the University of Florida, where I decided I wanted to work for this newspaper and make St. Petersburg my home. I started my career covering local governments in north Pinellas County, then moved to reporting on education. Thrifting is my favorite thing to do, and I spend a lot of time working with a local cat rescue.

write about transportation, a subject that affects all of us as we navigate our busy lives. I let you know how new projects will impact your commute and quality of life, while also dissecting complex policies and budgets. My work takes me from bus stops to government meetings to sitting in mind-numbing traffic jams. I’m a proud Hoosier, a slow runner, and a lover of mountains. I studied journalism and political science at Indiana University and earned my master’s at the University of Maryland. I joined the Times in 2012, first covering breaking news in Tampa and east Hillsborough. I attend 9-hour meetings and read traffic studies from the 1960s so you didn’t have to. I’m always looking for story ideas.\n","slug":"caitlin-johnston","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"expertise":"transportation ","last_updated_date":"2020-04-30T15:43:59.570Z","custom_phone":"(727) 893-8779","custom_tagline":"Contact Caitlin Johnston at cjohnston@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8779.

After 15 years as an editor in the Tampa suburbs I was assigned to cover the Hillsborough public school system, the same one that gave my two children a great education. That last part didn't happen by itself. I was an active volunteer and believe schools should accommodate parents' busy schedules. I’m not a fan of the 3 p.m. parent conference or 10 a.m. PTA meeting! On weekends I play tennis and volunteer at a youth soccer program. Call or email me with your tips about the schools. I use Facebook for family and Twitter for self-promotion.

Stuart</b> represents District 3 in North Hillsborough<i>. </i>But, after two terms on the board, she is running for Clerk of Court. It is an open primary against fellow Democrat Kevin Beckner. Stuart, who early on wanted schools to remain closed until after Labor Day, voted in favor of Davis’s plan on July 23 and against the four-week delay on Aug. 6. She said this week that she feels duty-bound to serve all constituents, those who want to keep their children home and those whose children need to be in school. That position has angered leaders of the teachers’ union, which threw its support to Beckner. On Wednesday, Stuart told the <i>Times:</i> “My position is, we need to adhere to the executive order (issued by Corcoran) and we need to provide equity for all kids, especially our most vulnerable.”"},{"_id":"R74J6PGBYYI6TNV2IBWI6S7HAY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/photo/resize/5RoSObVfxkZS_QLDW3vjsFCwvCo=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt/public/R74J6PGBYYI6TNV2IBWI6S7HAY.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"Ingestor","mime_type":"application/octet-stream","originalName":"AR-303299474.jp","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/R74J6PGBYYI6TNV2IBWI6S7HAY.jpg","proxyUrl":"/photo/resize/5RoSObVfxkZS_QLDW3vjsFCwvCo=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt/public/R74J6PGBYYI6TNV2IBWI6S7HAY.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"http://thumbor-prod-us-east-1.photo.aws.arc.pub/5RoSObVfxkZS_QLDW3vjsFCwvCo=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt/public/R74J6PGBYYI6TNV2IBWI6S7HAY.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"http://thumbor-prod-us-east-1.photo.aws.arc.pub/2ghLOTl4vbHPpR4hOVX7Nz-RP88=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt/public/R74J6PGBYYI6TNV2IBWI6S7HAY.jpg","version":1,"comments":[],"_id":"MLGHS4R4TZGYZM6T2XW62UQTXU"},"caption":"Cindy

all over Florida. After 15 years as an editor in the Tampa suburbs I was assigned to cover the Hillsborough public school system, the same one that gave my two children a great education. That last part didn't happen by itself. I was an active volunteer and believe schools should accommodate parents' busy schedules. I’m not a fan of the 3 p.m. parent conference or 10 a.m. PTA meeting! On weekends I play tennis and volunteer at a youth soccer program. Call or email me with your tips about the schools. I use Facebook for family and Twitter for self-promotion.

Each filter test, Chapman said, costs about $12.

drastic move. This move was not caused by my fear of earthquakes but my fear of not having a career in the vocation I adored. Family in tow we trekked cross country, on a plane, and landed at The Tampa Tribune. I am lucky to be one of the few who were plucked by the Tampa Bay Times after the purchase of the Tribune in 2016. My family and I have grown to love the Tampa Bay area. We spend off times floating on the intercostal and biking along the Pinellas Trail. I am extremely passionate about photojournalism and a strong advocate of photojournalism ethics. When asked, I tell people I am just a SoCal expat attempting to live the Florida lifestyle and I make visuals awesome.","slug":"chris-urso","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2020-04-30T16:00:00.181Z","custom_phone":"‪(727) 487-2449‬","custom_tagline":"Contact Chris Urso at curso@tampabay.com.

It's what drew me to the art and led me to purchase my first camera. I learned to make pictures while documenting participants attending a military-style summer leadership camp in New England. Since then, I've worked on the digital team for a newsroom in Utah and more recently interned on its photo staff. I am close to completing my second bachelor's degree in photojournalism at Western Kentucky University. I see moments (*nudge nudge, wink wink* my initials are I.C.) that help readers connect with the people in front of my lens.

area.","slug":"ivy-ceballo","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2020-06-16T22:59:25.041Z","custom_tagline":"Contact Ivy Ceballo at

I transitioned to making pictures of all my family, other families, a small wedding here or there. But the pros I admired were working in photojournalism and it was those types of photos I wanted to make. I went back to school in 2014 and got a degree in journalism. Now I'm thrilled to be the rookie photographer on the multimedia team for my hometown paper. I live in St. Petersburg with my husband, two sons and two geckos.

cover the city of St. Petersburg — its residents, leaders and issues. The dramatics of Washington and Tallahassee often overshadow the work of local government, but City Hall is where the decisions are made that have the greatest impact on people’s daily lives. It’s my job to keep it interesting so more people stay engaged with their community. I’m also on the Tampa Bay Times’ hurricane team, and have been deployed to report on the aftermaths of three storms: Hermine in 2016, Irma in 2017 and Michael in 2018. I find serenity in following recipes, the more complicated the better. I’m a bourbon fan, an amatuer pizza critic and a Pinellas Trail bike rider. Otherwise I like watching YouTube and talking on the phone. I’m proudly from New Jersey, don’t @ me for it — or do, it won’t matter. I came to the Times in 2014 after graduating from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism.

I’m passionate about reporting on communities that may face extra challenges accessing care — immigrants, minorities, women, LGBTQ individuals, disabled people, prisoners, the uninsured and the poor. I’m a lifelong Floridian (from Coral Springs) and a University of Florida graduate.

all over Florida. After 15 years as an editor in the Tampa suburbs I was assigned to cover the Hillsborough public school system, the same one that gave my two children a great education. That last part didn't happen by itself. I was an active volunteer and believe schools should accommodate parents' busy schedules. I’m not a fan of the 3 p.m. parent conference or 10 a.m. PTA meeting! On weekends I play tennis and volunteer at a youth soccer program. Call or email me with your tips about the schools. I use Facebook for family and Twitter for self-promotion.
